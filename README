This solution contains two projects. I've only used them once to generate a cover for my thesis (unrelated subject). At the very least it may serve as a nice sample application, either for RESTful interfaces with .Net or for drawing with Cairo.

ColourLoversAPI
A simple API to ColourLovers.com using system libraries.

Dependencies:
System.Web, System.Xml and System.Drawing (for System.Drawing.Color, can be easily replaced)

CairoColours
A sample application to ColourLoversAPI. It uses Cairo and Pango to draw an image and uses the ColourLoversAPI to determine the colours.

Controls:
Space new drawing
Left/Right previous/next colour palette
Up/Down new seed for the random generator
b save to image on the Desktop (png)
s save to image on the Desktop (svg)
p save to image on the Desktop (pdf)
o toggle colour information
Escape/q quit

Dependencies:
GTK, Cairo, Pango, ColourLoversAPI
